## Run Petclinic locally

Spring Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) or [Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access the Petclinic at <http://localhost:8080/>
